          The joint family system has long been a core aspect of Nepalese society, particularly in rural and semi-urban settings.
          In this structure, multiple generations live together under the same roof, sharing responsibilities, income, and household duties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elder family members are highly respected and often serve as decision-makers. The system promotes emotional bonding and
          economic efficiency, as resources are pooled together. It fosters a sense of collective responsibility and mutual support,
          especially during festivals, crises, or major life events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joint families play a vital role in raising children with shared values, cultural identity, and strong moral foundations.
          Children grow up with support from grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, which enhances their social development and emotional well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          During festivals like Dashain and Tihar, the joint family setting becomes especially vibrant, with collective rituals, decorations,
          and shared meals strengthening family ties. The sense of belonging and cultural continuity it provides is hard to replicate in a nuclear setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          In times of illness or financial hardship, joint families offer a built-in support system. The collective caregiving and shared income
          reduce the burden on individual members, making the system more resilient in challenging times.

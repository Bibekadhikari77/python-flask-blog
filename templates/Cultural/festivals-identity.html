          <strong>Deuda</strong> is far more than just a traditional dance; it is a living cultural heritage that embodies the identity and social values of the Khas-Arya community in Karnali and Sudurpashchim provinces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word “Deuda” originates from “Deo” or “Dev,” meaning divine, reflecting the sacred nature of the dance and songs performed during key festivals such as Gaura Parva and Saune Sankranti.
        </p>
        <p>
          Performed in a circle, the dance involves men and women holding hands and stepping rhythmically in unison. The performers are led by singers who recite verses that narrate mythology, local legends, heroic tales, and social messages, making Deuda an important oral storytelling tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inclusive and communal nature of Deuda strengthens social bonds, inviting participation across all ages and castes. The lyrics often explore philosophical ideas, cultural wisdom, and lessons on life, fostering unity and cultural pride.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite pressures of modernization, Deuda continues to thrive especially in districts such as Achham, Doti, Jumla, and Bajura. Efforts by cultural organizations, schools, and artists to preserve and promote this art form through competitions and documentation ensure its vibrant legacy for future generations.

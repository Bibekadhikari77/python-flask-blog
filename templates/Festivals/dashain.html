          <strong>Dashain</strong> is the most important and widely celebrated festival in Sudurpaschim Province, symbolizing the victory of good over evil. The festival is marked by great enthusiasm, spiritual devotion, and cultural richness.
        </p>
        <p>
          During Dashain, families thoroughly clean and decorate their homes and worship Goddess Durga to seek her blessings for prosperity and protection. It is also a time for family reunions where relatives gather to celebrate together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditional rituals such as receiving <em>tika</em> and <em>jamara</em> from elders, as well as animal sacrifices in some communities, play a central role in the festivities. These rituals symbolize blessings, renewal, and gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          The festival promotes social harmony and unity as elders bless younger family members with tika and money, and communities engage in cultural activities like the vibrant Deuda dance and folk singing gatherings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond its religious significance, Dashain is a vibrant cultural expression and a time to strengthen community bonds in Sudurpaschim.

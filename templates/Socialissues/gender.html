          In Sudurpaschim Province, gender inequality has historically been deep-rooted in traditional customs and patriarchal norms. Women were often confined to household responsibilities, deprived of education, and excluded from economic participation and leadership roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Local women’s cooperatives and microfinance groups have enabled thousands of women to start small businesses, become financially independent, and contribute to household income. Women-led enterprises are gaining ground in agriculture, handicrafts, and services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, women in Sudurpaschim are breaking traditional barriers. From becoming school teachers, nurses, and government officers to contesting local elections and leading NGOs, they are shaping the province's progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite challenges like gender-based violence and limited access to reproductive health, ongoing efforts from government and civil society continue to push for equality, inclusion, and empowerment of all genders.

          Social awareness in Sudurpaschim is growing as a result of collective efforts by educators, community leaders, activists, and digital influencers. While older generations held tightly to customs and traditions, the new wave of awareness is challenging harmful practices like caste-based discrimination, gender-based violence, and superstition.

          Awareness campaigns on personal hygiene, sanitation, education rights, early marriage prevention, and civic responsibilities are regularly conducted in rural schools and community halls. These are often supported by local governments and development partners.

          The rise of FM radio stations, community newspapers, and internet access in urban and semi-urban areas has given people access to news, laws, and development information. Even in remote hills, visual street dramas and cultural programs help spread important messages in local dialects.

          Youth clubs, mother’s groups, and social mobilizers play a vital role in organizing health camps, climate education sessions, and inclusive policy discussions. Increasingly, citizens are aware of their rights, responsibilities, and the importance of social harmony and sustainable development.

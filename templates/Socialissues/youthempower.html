          Youth empowerment is becoming a central force for positive change in Sudurpaschim Province. With over 50% of the province’s population under the age of 30, the energy and potential of young people is critical to regional development. However, many youths still face barriers such as unemployment, poverty, skill gaps, and lack of access to quality education.
        </p>
        <p>
          To combat these challenges, the provincial government, NGOs, and youth-led networks have introduced skill development training, vocational education, entrepreneurship programs, and digital literacy workshops. Initiatives like Youth Info Centers and career counseling services are helping youth access resources and make informed life decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sudurpaschim’s youth are also active in environmental conservation, climate action, mental health awareness, drug abuse prevention, and volunteerism. Many have returned from foreign employment to start agri-based startups and tech ventures, creating jobs locally and reducing migration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through platforms such as student unions, youth parliaments, and sports clubs, the young generation is gaining confidence, leadership experience, and a voice in the socio-political landscape. They are not just the future—they are actively shaping the present of Sudurpaschim.

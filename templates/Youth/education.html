          Inclusive education searches for ways to design schools, programs, classrooms, and lessons for all children to learn and participate. It includes finding several teaching methods to actively involve the pupils in developing mutual respect, relationships, and friendships among themselves and between teachers and children in a classroom setup.

          Children do not need to earn their participation in attending schools and classrooms. They do not have to be ready for education because inclusive education empowers schools to be creative in encouraging all kids to participate. Teachers must be creative in teaching to get every child involved. Inclusive education is a reflection of everyone’s expectation of children’s acceptance and appreciation throughout life.

          The government and local organizations are working tirelessly to improve infrastructure, teacher training, and digital access in remote areas of Sudurpaschim, aiming to bridge educational gaps and provide equal opportunities to all children regardless of their background.
